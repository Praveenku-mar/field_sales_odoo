patches.txt once listed this app's patches as ``field_sales.patches.v1_0.*`` (copied from the
Shopify edition), so existing sites logged them under those names. They are now listed as
``field_sales_odoo.patches.v1_0.*``: copy each logged old name to its new name so the
renamed patches count as done there instead of running a second time. Fresh sites have no
old entries and run the patches normally.
