"""
Stock by location, and live stock: ask the store for current quantities instead of trusting the last sync.

Platform-neutral; talks to the store only through ``get_connector()``. Used by
"Refresh Stock", the Field Order submit check, the app's order screen, the
product sync and the stock webhook.

Stock lives in ``Product Stock`` (one row per product and location).
``Platform Product.available_qty`` is a copy of the *default* location's row, so
lists, number cards and presets that read it keep working. Write stock only
through ``set_location_stock`` so the two never drift apart.
