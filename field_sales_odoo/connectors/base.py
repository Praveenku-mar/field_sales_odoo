"""
Platform-agnostic connector contract.

Core code (sync jobs, doc events, API endpoints) talks to a store only through
an instance returned by ``field_sales_odoo.connectors.get_connector()``. Every
platform connector subclasses ``BaseConnector`` and returns data in the
normalized shapes documented below, so callers never branch on platform.

IDs are plain platform ids (e.g. Shopify's numeric id, not its ``gid://`` form)
so they are safe in document names; each connector converts them back as needed.

Normalized product dict (one per *variant*)::

	{
		"external_product_id": str,
		"external_variant_id": str,
		"external_inventory_id": str | None,
		"product_title": str,
		"variant_title": str | None,
		"sku": str | None,
		"barcode": str | None,
		"price": float,
		"compare_at_price": float | None,
		"collection": str | None,
		"image_url": str | None,
		"status": "Active" | "Draft" | "Archived",
		"track_inventory": bool,
	}

Webhooks: the store pushes events to ``field_sales_odoo.api.webhooks.receive``, which
verifies and parses them through the connector, so everything after that is
platform-neutral. A parsed event is::

	{
		"topic": "stock/update" | "product/update" | "product/delete"
			| "order/paid" | "order/fulfilled" | "order/cancelled" | "refund/create" | other,
		"platform_topic": str,       # the store's own topic name, for logs
		"event_id": str | None,      # unique per delivery; used to drop duplicates
		"updated_at": str | None,    # ISO timestamp of the change, to order events
		"payload": dict,             # the store's JSON body, untouched
	}

Normalized order dict (``get_order``), used for commission. Statuses are the
platform's, mapped to these lowercase words::

	{
		"external_order_id": str,
		"currency": str,
		"financial_status": "pending" | "authorized" | "partially_paid" | "paid"
			| "partially_refunded" | "refunded" | "voided" | "expired" | "",
		"fulfillment_status": "fulfilled" | "partial" | "unfulfilled" | other lowercase,
		"cancelled": bool,
		"lines": [
			{
				"line_id": str,
				"external_variant_id": str | None,   # None for custom lines (e.g. tax)
				"qty": float,                        # all units, including refunded
				"current_qty": float,                # units not refunded / removed
				"unit_price": float,                 # before discounts and tax
				"discount": float,                   # total discount allocated to the line
				"product_type": str | None,
				"tags": [str, ...],
			},
		],
		"refunds": [
			{"refund_id": str, "lines": [{"line_id": str, "qty": float, "amount": float}]},
		],
	}

Amounts are in the order's own ``currency``.
